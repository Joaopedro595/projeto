        <h3>What is Football:</h3>  
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football">
        <ul>
            <li><p>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played between<br> 
                 two teams of 11 players each, who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field <br>
                 called a pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball<br> 
                 beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game <br>
                 has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million<br>
                 players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.</li></p>

                    <li> Association football is one of a family of football codes that emerged from various ball games<br>
                         played worldwide since antiquity. Within the English-speaking world, the sport is now usually <br>
                         called "football" in Great Britain and most of Ulster in the north of Ireland, whereas people <br>
                         usually call it "soccer" in regions and countries where other codes of football are prevalent,<br>
                         such as Australia,[8] Canada, South Africa, most of Ireland (excluding Ulster),[9] and the <br>
                         United States; in Japan, the game is also primarily called sakkā (サッカー), derived from <br>
                         "soccer". A notable exception is New Zealand, where in the first two decades of the 21st <br>
                         century, under the influence of international television, "football" has been gaining <br>
                         prevalence, despite the dominance of other codes of football, namely rugby union and <br>
                         rugby league. The term soccer comes from Oxford "-er" slang, which was prevalent at the <br>
                         University of Oxford in England from about 1875, and is thought to have been borrowed from<br>
                         the slang of Rugby School. Initially spelled assoccer, it was later reduced to the modern <br>
                         spelling. This form of slang also gave rise to rugger for rugby football, fiver and tenner<br>
                         for five pound and ten pound notes, and the now-archaic footer that was also a name for <br>
                         association football.[12] The word soccer arrived at its final form in 1895 and was first<br>
                         recorded in 1889 in the earlier form of socca.</li>

            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football" class="third">
                <ul>
                    <li>Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the <br>
                        Game. The game is played using a spherical ball of 68–70 cm (27–28 in) circumference, known <br>
                        as the football (or soccer ball). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into <br>
                        the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that <br>
                        has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number <br>
                        of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility <br>
                        s mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss before kick-off or penalty kicks.<br>
                        The primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms<br>
                        during play, though they must use both their hands during a throw-in restart.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football#:~:text=America.%5B85%5D-,Gameplay,-Main%20article%3A">..Read More...</a></li>
