        <h3>The history of football (soccer)</h3>

    <li><p>Football (or soccer as the game is called in some parts of the world) has a long history.<br>
    Football in its current form arose in England in the middle of the 19th century. But alternative<br>
    versions of the game existed much earlier and are a part of the football history.</p>

        <li><p>The first known examples of a team game involving a ball, which was made out of a rock, occurred <br>
         in old Mesoamerican cultures for over 3,000 years ago. It was by the Aztecs called Tchatali, although<br>
        various versions of the game were spread over large regions. In some ritual occasions, the ball would<br>
        symbolize the sun and the captain of the losing team would be sacrificed to the gods.<a href="https://www.footballhistory.org/#:~:text=Early%20history%20and%20the%20precursors%20of%20football">..Read more...</a></p></li>

         <li><p>The most admitted story tells that the game was developed in England in the 12th century.<br>
        In this century, games that resembled football were played on meadows and roads in England.<br>
        Besides from kicks, the game involved also punches of the ball with the fist. This early <br>
        form of football was also much more rough and violent than the modern way of playing.<a href="https://www.footballhistory.org/#:~:text=The%20game%20of%20football%20takes%20its%20form">..Read more...</a>
